Lung Cancer Prediction

This project predicts the likelihood of lung cancer using patient health data and machine learning. The model is built with Python and trained to classify whether a person may have lung cancer based on key risk factors.

Project Overview

Language: Python

Libraries used: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy, Scikit-learn

Goal: Help in early detection of lung cancer using data-driven methods.

Steps in the Project

Data Loading – Import the lung cancer dataset.

Data Cleaning – Handle missing values and encode categorical variables (e.g., gender, lung cancer labels).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Create visualizations like correlation heatmaps to find patterns.

Statistical Tests – Perform chi-square tests and correlation checks to select important features.

Model Training – Train machine learning models (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression).

Evaluation – Measure performance using accuracy, mean squared error, and classification reports.

Results

Logistic Regression achieved good accuracy in predicting lung cancer.

Statistical analysis showed which health factors (like smoking) have stronger correlation with lung cancer.

Visualizations (like heatmaps) help to better understand relationships in the dataset.

Future Work

Try advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost, or Neural Networks).

Expand dataset for better performance.

Deploy as a simple web or mobile app for wider use.
