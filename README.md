Lung Cancer Prediction

This project predicts the likelihood of lung cancer using machine learning.

Purpose: Enable early detection of lung cancer through data analysis.
Problem: Lung cancer is often diagnosed late; early prediction can save lives.
Solution: A model trained on health-related data to predict cancer risk.

Libraries Used: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy, Scikit-learn
Methods: Data cleaning, EDA (heatmaps, correlations), statistical tests (chi-square), Logistic Regression, Linear Regression

Results: Logistic Regression achieved strong accuracy; smoking and related health factors identified as key predictors.
Future Work: Implement advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks) and deploy as a simple web/mobile app.
